# Description
This tool helps you to find the server real ip address protected behind services like **Cloudflare, Akamai, and others WAF/CDN services**... 

# How it works?
Giving a hostname (ex: site.com), a website html match (ex: "welmcome to site.com") and an ipv4 addresses or range list, this tool will send http/s requests to all ipv4 addresses checking if any of them responds with the match.

# How can I get possibles ipv4 ranges?
There exists a lot of ways to find possible ipv4 ranges where can be hosted the real server ip address, here I expose some:
 - Search target company ipv4 ranges/addresses in online services like ipv4info.com
 - Shodan, Censys...
 - Get ranges of the ipv4 addresses exposed in subdomains
 - Get ranges of ipv4 addresses exposed in emails raw data
 - Try to get more ipv4 addresses in dns history
